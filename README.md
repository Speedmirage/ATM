# What this Program does?

This program virtually introduces the user to a ATM main menu. The program allows for the user to access their virtual *Savings*, *Checking* **AND** *Credit* Accounts. While also implementing advance techniques like **exception handling**. 


## How to Run it?

Since this program requires multiple files to run; It wasn't able to run on a cloud based compiler. Therefore, you can find all the necessary files [here](). Lastly, if you are using Xcode an Xcode project was included for your convinience :).
